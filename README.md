# SecurePasswordValidator_

This project includes a regex-based password strength checker that validates whether a password meets security criteria such as length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers), and special symbols.

Password Strength Requirements
To ensure strong and secure passwords, the following requirements must be met:

1. Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
2. Lowercase Letters: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
3. Uppercase Letters: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
4. Digits: The password must include at least one digit (0-9).
5. Special Characters: The password must contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *).
6. No Common Words: Avoid using easily guessable words such as your name, dictionary words, or sequential numbers.
   
These requirements help ensure the strength of the password, making it more secure and harder to guess or crack.
